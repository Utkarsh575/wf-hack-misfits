# üöÄ Project Name: AI-Powered Oracle Compliance System for AML Smart Contract checksüåü


## Description

This project implements an AI-powered oracle and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance system for blockchain custodial wallets. The system enables smart contracts associated with custodial wallets to perform only approved transactions, ensuring that any non-custodial wallet suspected of money laundering cannot transact with custodial wallets. The architecture leverages a multi-agent AML checker using LangGraph and OpenAI, a Django service for on-chain data analysis, and an oracle service that signs or blocks transactions based on compliance checks.

## üéØ Introduction

### AML Smart Contract checks for Non-Custodial Wallets using Oracle & Google datasets

This project demonstrates a secure, AI-driven compliance architecture for blockchain custodial wallets. It consists of:

- **Sample Smart Contract**: A CosmWasm contract that interacts with the oracle for transaction approval.
- **Django Service**: Implements a multi-agent AML checker using LangGraph and OpenAI, fetching live on-chain data and performing compliance analysis.
- **Oracle Service**: Signs transactions for the smart contract using its private key, but only if the involved wallets pass AML checks. If a wallet is non-compliant, the oracle blocks the transaction.

The system ensures that custodial wallets are protected from receiving funds from wallets flagged for money laundering or other compliance risks.

## üí° Inspiration

This project was created during the D.A.T.A Innovation Showcase Hackathon to showcase how AI-driven compliance and blockchain oracles can improve the security and regulatory compliance of custodial wallets and smart contracts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does

### Features

- **On-chain AML Compliance**: All transactions to custodial wallets are checked for AML compliance using a multi-agent system.
- **Oracle-based Transaction Approval**: The oracle service signs transactions only if the AML check passes, otherwise blocks the transaction.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: The sample contract requires oracle approval for sensitive operations.
- **Live Blockchain Data Analysis**: The Django service fetches and analyzes live blockchain data for compliance checks.
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: The Django service uses LangGraph and OpenAI agents to perform layered compliance analysis (sanctions, structuring, layering, etc.).
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes transaction networks and compliance status.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

        SC["Sample Smart Contract"]
    end
    subgraph Backend
        ORA["Oracle Service"]
        DJ["Django AML Service (Multi-Agent)"]
    end

    SC -- "Request Approval" --> ORA
    ORA -- "Run Compliance Check" --> DJ
    DJ -- "Fetch On-chain Data" --> Blockchain
    DJ -- "Compliance Result" --> ORA
    ORA -- "Sign/Block Tx" --> SC
    SC -- "Transaction Result" --> UI
```

### Signature Generation & Checking Flow

```mermaid

    participant Oracle
    participant DjangoAML
    participant Blockchain
    User->>SmartContract: Initiate transfer
    SmartContract->>Oracle: Request signature
    Oracle->>DjangoAML: Is sender AML compliant?
    DjangoAML->>Blockchain: Fetch sender tx history
    DjangoAML->>DjangoAML: Multi-agent analysis (sanctions, structuring, etc)
    DjangoAML-->>Oracle: Compliance result (pass/fail)
    Oracle-->>SmartContract: Signature or error
    SmartContract-->>User: Success or compliance failure
```

### Multi-Agent AML Analysis (Django Service)

```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in each service root as needed. Example for Django:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ORACLE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd wf-hack-test
   ```
2. **Set Up Local Cosmos SDK Blockchain (Docker)**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```
   This will set up and start a local Cosmos SDK blockchain using Docker.
3. **Set Up Python Backend (Django AML Service)**:
   ```bash
   cd code/src/django_service
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn django_service.asgi:application --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
   ```
4. **Set Up Oracle Service**:
   ```bash
   cd ../oracle-service
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Deploy/Instantiate Smart Contract**:
   (See contract folder for instructions)

6. **Access the Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   cd ../aml-oracle-dashboard
   pnpm i
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. **Initiate a Transaction**: User initiates a transfer from a non-custodial wallet to a custodial wallet via the smart contract UI.
2. **Oracle Approval**: The smart contract requests a signature from the oracle service.
3. **AML Compliance Check**: The oracle calls the Django AML service, which runs multi-agent analysis on the sender wallet using live blockchain data.
4. **Transaction Decision**: If the sender passes compliance, the oracle signs the transaction; otherwise, it is blocked and the user is notified.
5. **Dashboard**: Users and admins can view transaction network graphs and compliance status in the dashboard.

## üöß Challenges We Faced

- **Newness to Rust**: Our team had limited prior experience with Rust, which made developing and debugging the CosmWasm smart contract a significant learning curve.
- **Integration of Oracle Logic**: Integrating the oracle service with both the smart contract and the Django AML backend required careful design to ensure secure and reliable communication.
- **Designing the receive_with_approval Architecture**: Architecting the `receive_with_approval` flow in the smart contract to require oracle approval for sensitive transactions was challenging and required several iterations to get right.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple AI agents for layered AML checks using LangGraph and OpenAI introduced complexity in both logic and error handling.
- **Integrating live blockchain data fetching and analysis in real time**: Ensuring that the Django service could fetch and analyze on-chain data quickly and reliably was a key technical challenge.
- **Designing a robust multi-agent AML checker using LangGraph and OpenAI**: Building a system that could flexibly combine different compliance checks and aggregate their results required careful orchestration.
- **Ensuring secure and reliable oracle signing for smart contract transactions**: The oracle's signing logic had to be both secure and robust against edge cases and failures.
- **Handling edge cases for compliance failures and user feedback**: Providing clear feedback to users and handling all possible compliance failure scenarios was essential for a good user experience.
